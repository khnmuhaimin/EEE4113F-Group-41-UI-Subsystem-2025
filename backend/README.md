# EEE4113F-Group-41-UI-Subsystem-2025

## Overview
I'll put the code and stuff for the UI subsystem here.

## Getting Started

To start the server, run ```./scripts.sh start-server```.

To expose the server to the internet, run ```./scripts.sh start-tunnel```.

The shell file ```scripts.sh``` contains some other functions too. To view them, run ```./scripts.sh```.

## Environment Variables

The ```.env``` file contains some configuration settings that the project needs. If the ```.env``` file doesn't exist yet, run ```./scripts.sh```. It'll generate the ```.env``` file that you'll need to fill out.
